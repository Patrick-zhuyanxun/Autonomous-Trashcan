//put Leader at the beginning point of the map，Slaves can be set nearby
//logging in remotely using the SSH command, click "Broadcast to All" in the upper left corner of the split terminal to synchronize the time using the command
//Step1：launch the 2D navigation function with Leader
roslaunch turn_on_wheeltec_robot navigation.launch 
//Step 2：launch the formation function with Slaves
roslaunch wheeltec_multi wheeltec_slave.launch
//Step 3：using keyboard or controller and control Leader's movement

Other common commands

Recursively changes the file modification time in the current (terminal) folder:
find ./* -exec touch {} \;

Run in workspace, install ROS feature pack all depend on:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

Change the system time:
sudo date -s "2022-06-15 09:00:00"

Specify feature pack compilation:
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="package name"
Uncompile the specified feature pack:
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES=""

SSH login：
ssh -Y wheeltec@192.168.0.100

NFS mount:
